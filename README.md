# AgentX

![](agentx-proposed-architecture.png)

AgentX is an AI controller that relies on three LLM chains to perform tasks. The code for AgentX was inspired by [this example](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/use_cases/agents/baby_agi.html) and [this repository](https://github.com/yoheinakajima/babyagi/tree/main).

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Create a Python 3.8 virtual environment: `python3.8 -m venv .venv`
3. Activate the virtual environment: `source .venv/bin/activate`
4. Copy `.env.example` to create `.env`.
5. Set your OpenAI API key in `.env`.
6. Install the required modules by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Usage

To run the AgentX controller, run the following command with the virtual environment activated:

```
python main.py
```

This will start the AgentX controller and run it until it completes all tasks or until it reaches the maximum number of iterations.

## Requirements

The following modules are required and can be installed using the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`:

```
langchain
openai
pydantic
faiss-cpu
tiktoken
```

## .env.example

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=
